Q. List out the features of HTML5?

HTML5 brought a significant evolution to web development by introducing several new features and improvements. Here is a list of key features and improvements in HTML5:

1. **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. These elements provide a clearer structure to web documents and help search engines and assistive technologies better understand content.

2. **Multimedia Support**:
   - `<audio>` and `<video>` elements for native audio and video playback without plugins.
   - `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics, animations, and games.
   - `<svg>` element for scalable vector graphics.

3. **Improved Forms**:
   - New input types such as `email`, `url`, `number`, and `date`.
   - New form elements like `<datalist>` for autocompletion, `<keygen>` for key pairs, and `<output>` for calculation results.
   - Built-in form validation and the `pattern` attribute for custom validation.

4. **Local Storage and Session Storage**: `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` provide client-side storage for web applications, allowing data to be stored persistently or temporarily.

5. **Geolocation**: HTML5 allows websites to request and access the user's geographical location through the Geolocation API.

6. **Web Workers**: Web Workers enable multi-threading in web applications, allowing tasks to run in the background without affecting the main UI thread's performance.

7. **WebSockets**: WebSocket support facilitates real-time, full-duplex communication between the client and server, enabling interactive web applications.

8. **Drag and Drop**: HTML5 introduced the ability to drag and drop elements and files within a web page.

9. **Offline Web Applications**: The Application Cache (AppCache) allows web applications to work offline by caching resources.

10. **Improved Accessibility**: HTML5 introduced accessibility features like the `alt` attribute for images, `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for image descriptions, and more ARIA roles and attributes for better accessibility.

11. **Responsive Web Design**: Media queries and new elements like `<picture>` and `<srcset>` support responsive web design, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

12. **New APIs**:
    - **Web Storage API**: Provides access to local and session storage.
    - **History API**: Allows manipulation of the browser's history stack.
    - **Canvas API**: Enables dynamic rendering and drawing.
    - **Web Audio API**: Provides advanced audio processing capabilities.
    - **Full-Screen API**: Allows web applications to enter full-screen mode.
    - **Notification API**: Provides notifications to users.
    - **WebRTC**: Enables real-time communication directly between browsers.

13. **Security Improvements**:
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    - **Sandboxed iframes**: Isolate third-party content in iframes.
    - **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Controls which domains can access resources on a web page.

14. **Scalability**: HTML5 was designed to be backward compatible, making it easy for developers to transition from older versions of HTML while embracing modern web development practices.

15. **Improved Performance**: HTML5 and its associated technologies often lead to improved website performance due to features like local storage, better forms, and multimedia support.

16. **Mobile-Friendly**: HTML5's responsive design features and multimedia capabilities have contributed to the development of mobile-friendly and cross-platform web applications.

HTML5 has significantly enhanced web development by offering a richer set of features and better support for modern web applications and content.
