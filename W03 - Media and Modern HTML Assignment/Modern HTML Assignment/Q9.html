<!-- Create a simple webpage with a form for a user to enter their personal information. The form should
contain three input fields with the labels "First Name", "Last Name", and "Email". The first input field should
have a tabindex value of 2. The second input field should have a tabindex value of 1. The third input field
should have a tabindex value of 4. The form should have a submit button with the label "Submit" and a
tabindex value of 3. Observe the behaviors of tab index on your webpage -->

<!-- OBSERVATIONS 
    1. The "Last Name" input field has a tabindex of 1, making it the first item to receive focus when using the "Tab" key.
    2. The "First Name" input field has a tabindex of 2, making it the second item in the tab order.
    3. The "Submit" button has a tabindex of 3, making it the third item in the tab order.
    4. The "Email" input field has a tabindex of 4, making it the last item in the tab order.

        When we open this webpage and use the "Tab" key to navigate through the form, we will observe that the tab order follows the specified tabindex values, starting with "Last Name," then moving to "First Name," followed by "Submit," and finally "Email."
