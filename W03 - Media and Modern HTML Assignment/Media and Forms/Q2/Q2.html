<!-- 
    NOTE : 
        In this code:
            1. We have an HTML img element that displays the "PW Skills" logo. The src attribute should be set to the actual path or URL of the image file .
        
            2. The alt attribute is used to provide alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility.
        
            3. We've added a title attribute with the value "PW Skills." This attribute provides additional information about the image and is often displayed as a tooltip when you hover over the image in a web browser.
